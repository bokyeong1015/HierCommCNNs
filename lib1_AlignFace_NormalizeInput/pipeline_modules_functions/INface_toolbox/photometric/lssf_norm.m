% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The function performs photometric normalization of the image X using the 
% large and small scale features approach from the reference paper. Hre,
% the first input argument is image to be normalized, and the second is
% again a parameter controlig whether the processed image is scaled to the
% 8-bit interval in the end or not.
% 
% Different from the original apporach, we have not implemented the LTV
% model for the decomposition in the first step. Rather we have used the
% single scale retinex technique for both steps - normalization of the
% small scale as well as normalization of the large scale features. One can
% argue that this is not as effective as the method proposed by the
% authors, esspecially considering the fact that the authors show
% differences in the (first-spet) decomposition, when different techniques
% are used (Fig. 3). However, it is obvious that the same effect can be 
% achieved by tuning the methods parameters and basically adjusting the 
% cut-off frequency, since most photometric normalization technique act as 
% sort of highpass filters. Performing a second normalization step on the 
% large scale features has (approximatelly) the effect of adjusting the cut-off
% frequency. Hence, we used again the SSR technique for the second step.
% 
% The only possiblity to improve upon the results, is to use some
% background knowledge - the PCA basis as suggested by the authors.
% However, this step makes the techniques limited to frontal faces or to be
% general requires a pose identification procedure and additinal subspaces.
% We have therefore not implemented the technique with the NPL approach.
% 
% The last step (the preimaging) is actually a recognition step and more or
% less useless for recognition, but you have to do that by hand.
% 
% Based on the above comments I would use this function with care, since it
% is basicaly the same as SSR with adjusted parameters. You are, however,
% welcomed to replace the SSR technique with some other method from this
% toolbox. 
% 
% A useful technique from the reference paper is the treshold averging,
% which is also implemented in this toolbox.

% INPUTS:
% X                     - a grey-scale image of arbitrary size
% normalize             - a parameter controlling the post-processing
%                         procedure:
%                            0 - no normalization
%                            1 - perform basic normalization (range 
%                                adjustment to the 8-bit interval) - default

% OUTPUTS:
% Y                     - a grey-scale image normalized using the lssf
%                         technique
